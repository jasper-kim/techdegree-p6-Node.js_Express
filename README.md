# techdegree-p6-Node.js_Express

## What it is
This is not only my portfolio site, but also a project to demonstrate a skill set of "server-side" JavaScript.
Using Node.js, npm and Express, I code the followings:
    - Import the required dependencies
    - Link the JSON with the Pug templates
    - Set up routes to handle requests
    - Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
    - Handle errors
    - Set up a server to serve the project

## How it works
There is no special instruction to use the site. Feel free to browse my projects and find out about me.
